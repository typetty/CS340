# CS340 - Ty Petty
<h3>How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>There are two things that I do to make the code readable an modular. The first is to split it into sections or methods. I try to encapsulate all the functionality into pieces that can be reused. The second thing is to add comments to the code. It is important that the people that see the code later on know what I was thinking. Additionally, I often need a reminder of what my code is. I will continue to use this process in the future.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When I come across a problem as a computer scientist, I try to make clear what my problem is and what solution I am wanting to see. Once that is established in my mind, I like to look at solutions that others have done for similar things. I think I used this approach in this assignment as well. I would test a few things and then look up some code snippets on stack overflow to see what others had done in a similar situation. I have enjoyed this strategy and think I will continue it in the future.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Part of the work that computer scientitsts do is cleaning the data and ensuring the data integrity. Then we have to create a UI to show the user the data. A project like this dashboard to display and filter data from their database could really help them analyze and access their data. This will help them manage their animals and data better.</li>
</ul>
