# CS340 - Ty Petty
<h3>How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>There are two things that I do to make the code readable an modular. The first is to split it into sections or methods. I try to encapsulate all the functionality into pieces that can be reused. The second thing is to add comments to the code. It is important that the people that see the code later on know what I was thinking. Additionally, I often need a reminder of what my code is. I will continue to use this process in the future.</li>

<h3>How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?</h3>
<h3>What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?</h3>
